Japanese soldiers who had served in Manchuria had developed a taste for crispy Chinese dumplings and other delicious foods. So back in Japan they started a new demand for gyoza as its appearance and the way it is cooked isn't too different to Chinese dumpling, although the flavor is another kettle of fish.<br> <br>
